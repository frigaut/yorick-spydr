Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.0 (Mon, 21 Jan 2008 01:36:46 -0300)

New Features:
- added a number of command line flags (see man page or spydr -h)
- can now handle series of image of different sizes
- can mix single image and cube
- cmin and cmax are now set per image (sticky setting)
- image titles are better handled
- updated man page
- new image can be opened from the GUI menu (filechooser, multiple
  selection ok)
- migrated to a spydrs structure, replaced many different variables, cleaner.
- now opens the GUI even with no image argument (can use "open" from menu)
- all errors are now also displayed as popups (critical quits yorick
  when called from shell)
- because some (of the more critical) errors can happen before python is
  started, I had to use zenity for the popup window. New dependency.
- added an "append" keyword to spydr. If set, the new image is appended
  to the list of displayed image. The old ones are kept, and the total
  number of image is ++
- append is also available from the GUI menu
- any action on displayed image can be null by using "help->refresh
  display" (in particular, sigmafilter)
- created "about" dialog.
- added an "image" menu (with names of all images in stack). user can
  select image form there.
- added an "ops" (operation) menu. Can compute median, average, sum and
  rms of cube.
- small gui (without lower panel) form is called with --compact (-c)
- switched to GPLv3
	
Bug fixes:
- fixed path to find python and glade files
- fixed path for configuration file
- main routine re-written and much more robust and clean
- (kind of) solved a issue where image got displayed several times
  because of echo from setting cmin and cmax
- fixed thibaut bug when closing window.
- fixed "called_from_shell" when no image argument.
- waiting for a doc for the user buttons, set to insivible.
- waiting for a proper implementation of find, pane set to invisible.


- bug: sometimes the next/previous image does not register
