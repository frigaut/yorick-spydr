Francois Rigaut, v 0.8.0

- patched the histo error bug.
- added digits to GUI cmin/cmax/histbin entries
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.8 (?)

- bug fix: plugin pane show state stays after loading new image
- new "clean_after" function for status bar
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.7 (Tue, 12 Feb 2008 14:54:30 +0100)
	
- fixed a bug when spydr_lut is not 0 and one creates a new
  window.
- other minor bug fixes.
- updated spydr man page
- written and published web doc on maumae.
- changed API for the strehl aperture mask. Now called spydr_strehl_aper,
  and is expressed in pixels (to be homogeneous with boxsize). both
  boxsize and strehlaper are diameters (or side length=size for boxsize).
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.6 (Sun, 10 Feb 2008 12:39:10 +0100)

- can now change the dpi on the fly. ctrl++ and ctrl+- will enlarge
  or shrink the graphical areas. long time missing in yorick.
  I have tried to make the window resizable, but it's a mess. Not
  only in the management of events, but also in the policy: really,
  only enlarging proportionally makes sense.
- changed a bit the zoom behavior: now zoom is started once (the first
  time the mouse enter drawingarea1), and does not stop from that point.
  This is not ideal/economical (although disp_zoom returns immediately
  if the mouse is not in the image window), but it has the advantage
  of being sure the disp_zoom process does not spawn multiple instances
  (recurrent issue with "after").
- The menu items in the left menu bar are hidden/shown according to the
  window size.
- gotten rid of a few (unused) functions in spydr.i (the progressbar
  and message functions) that were conflicting with other pyk instances.
- there's now focus in and out functions that will reset the current
  window to what it was before the focus was given to spydr. This is
  convenient when one just want to popup a spydr window to look at an
  image, and then come back to whatever one was doing without having to
  execute a window,n command.
- fixed a bug in disp_cpc. Now, when a "e"/"E" command is executed
  while a subimage is displayed, the "e"/"E" applies to the displayed
  subimage, not the whole image.
- changed a bit the behavior of the lower graphical area: not the y
  range is the same as the image zcuts (cmin/cmax).
- fixed a small bug in get_subim (using floor/ceil instead of round
  for the indices determination).
- added "compact" keyword to the spydr function (when called from
  within yorick).
- clipping dpi values to [30,400].
- spydr.py: went for a self autodic instead of an explicit
  declaration of all functions.
- implemented smoothing by x2
- implemented 1d linear fitting

Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.5 (Fri, 08 Feb 2008 11:22:01 +0100)

- fixed a regression pointed and patched by thibaut (spydr
  would exit in error when trying to open an image from
  within yorick)
- fixed a bug in set_cmax
- set larger values for the min and max of cmin and cmax
  in spydr.glade (but can't find how to unset limits)
- even though this is little modification, the regression
  is serious enough that I release a 0.7.5
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.4 (Sat, 02 Feb 2008 17:14:07 -0300)

- gotten rid of clmfit in favor of direct lmfit call.
- added batch mode
- changed spydr startup script
- now fitted vector is displayed vector (before was fitting
  the whole e.g. cut, and not only the displayed part).
- fitting is slightly more robust (better starting values)
- fixed an issue with pick-up of star in psffit when in graph
  axis are in arcsec
- fixed an error when picking x or y cuts outside of image
- moved some error messages from popups to status bar
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.3 (Thu, 31 Jan 2008 12:35:01 -0300)
	
- can now display graphes with X/Y axis in arcsec
- cleaned up mode switching (tv/contours/surface). Now more reliable.
- contour filled and tv switch survive a mode switching (before, were
  reset)
- limits are sticky between switch of mode (especially when switching
  to contours)
- when axis in arcsec is selected, gaussian fit is expresed in arcsec too.
- added export to pdf, postscript, encapsulated postscript
- added menu to pick color of contour lines
- added menu to pick color of contour marks
- implemented contour legends on plots
- added menu to select position of contour legends
- new functionality to compute distance between 2 points (see shortcut
  "M" and "m").
- rebin now works both ways (increasing and decreasing number of pixels)
- added "hdu" command line keyword, and updated manpage.
- added hist-equalize option to LUT
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.2 (Tue, 29 Jan 2008 18:20:46 -0300)

- Added "save as","save", and export to jpeg and png menus/actions

Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.1 (Fri, 25 Jan 2008 12:40:10 -0300)

- bumped to 0.7.1 as I made a few changes 

Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.0 (Mon, 21 Jan 2008 01:36:46 -0300)

New Features:
- added a number of command line flags (see man page or spydr -h)
- can now handle series of image of different sizes
- can mix single image and cube
- cmin and cmax are now set per image (sticky setting)
- image titles are better handled
- updated man page
- new image can be opened from the GUI menu (filechooser, multiple
  selection ok)
- migrated to a spydrs structure, replaced many different variables, cleaner.
- now opens the GUI even with no image argument (can use "open" from menu)
- all errors are now also displayed as popups (critical quits yorick
  when called from shell)
- because some (of the more critical) errors can happen before python is
  started, I had to use zenity for the popup window. New dependency.
- added an "append" keyword to spydr. If set, the new image is appended
  to the list of displayed image. The old ones are kept, and the total
  number of image is ++
- append is also available from the GUI menu
- any action on displayed image can be null by using "help->refresh
  display" (in particular, sigmafilter)
- created "about" dialog.
- added an "image" menu (with names of all images in stack). user can
  select image form there.
- added an "ops" (operation) menu. Can compute median, average, sum and
  rms of cube.
- small gui (without lower panel) form is called with --compact (-c)
- switched to GPLv3
	
Bug fixes:
- fixed path to find python and glade files
- fixed path for configuration file
- main routine re-written and much more robust and clean
- (kind of) solved a issue where image got displayed several times
  because of echo from setting cmin and cmax
- fixed thibaut bug when closing window.
- fixed "called_from_shell" when no image argument.
- waiting for a doc for the user buttons, set to insivible.
- waiting for a proper implementation of find, pane set to invisible.


- bug: sometimes the next/previous image does not register
