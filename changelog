- gotten rid of clmfit in favor of direct lmfit call.
- added batch mode
- changed spydr startup script
- now fitted vector is displayed vector (before was fitting
  the whole e.g. cut, and not only the displayed part).
- fitting is slightly more robust (better starting values)
- fixed an issue with pick-up of star in psffit when in graph
  axis are in arcsec
- fixed an error when picking x or y cuts outside of image
- moved some error messages from popups to status bar
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.3 (Thu, 31 Jan 2008 12:35:01 -0300)
	
- can now display graphes with X/Y axis in arcsec
- cleaned up mode switching (tv/contours/surface). Now more reliable.
- contour filled and tv switch survive a mode switching (before, were
  reset)
- limits are sticky between switch of mode (especially when switching
  to contours)
- when axis in arcsec is selected, gaussian fit is expresed in arcsec too.
- added export to pdf, postscript, encapsulated postscript
- added menu to pick color of contour lines
- added menu to pick color of contour marks
- implemented contour legends on plots
- added menu to select position of contour legends
- new functionality to compute distance between 2 points (see shortcut
  "M" and "m").
- rebin now works both ways (increasing and decreasing number of pixels)
- added "hdu" command line keyword, and updated manpage.
- added hist-equalize option to LUT
	
Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.2 (Tue, 29 Jan 2008 18:20:46 -0300)

- Added "save as","save", and export to jpeg and png menus/actions

Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.1 (Fri, 25 Jan 2008 12:40:10 -0300)

- bumped to 0.7.1 as I made a few changes 

Francois Rigaut, v 0.7.0 (Mon, 21 Jan 2008 01:36:46 -0300)

New Features:
- added a number of command line flags (see man page or spydr -h)
- can now handle series of image of different sizes
- can mix single image and cube
- cmin and cmax are now set per image (sticky setting)
- image titles are better handled
- updated man page
- new image can be opened from the GUI menu (filechooser, multiple
  selection ok)
- migrated to a spydrs structure, replaced many different variables, cleaner.
- now opens the GUI even with no image argument (can use "open" from menu)
- all errors are now also displayed as popups (critical quits yorick
  when called from shell)
- because some (of the more critical) errors can happen before python is
  started, I had to use zenity for the popup window. New dependency.
- added an "append" keyword to spydr. If set, the new image is appended
  to the list of displayed image. The old ones are kept, and the total
  number of image is ++
- append is also available from the GUI menu
- any action on displayed image can be null by using "help->refresh
  display" (in particular, sigmafilter)
- created "about" dialog.
- added an "image" menu (with names of all images in stack). user can
  select image form there.
- added an "ops" (operation) menu. Can compute median, average, sum and
  rms of cube.
- small gui (without lower panel) form is called with --compact (-c)
- switched to GPLv3
	
Bug fixes:
- fixed path to find python and glade files
- fixed path for configuration file
- main routine re-written and much more robust and clean
- (kind of) solved a issue where image got displayed several times
  because of echo from setting cmin and cmax
- fixed thibaut bug when closing window.
- fixed "called_from_shell" when no image argument.
- waiting for a doc for the user buttons, set to insivible.
- waiting for a proper implementation of find, pane set to invisible.


- bug: sometimes the next/previous image does not register
